Architecture Overview

	•	Frontend:
	•	HTML, CSS, Bootstrap: Used for creating the embeddable chat icon and responsive user interface.
	•	Backend:
	•	Python, Flask: Flask will handle API requests, perform NLP tasks, and connect to the MySQL database.
	•	Database:
	•	MySQL: Stores all financial and customer portfolio data.
	•	LLM (Large Language Model):
	•	OpenAI’s API: Used to interpret user queries and generate appropriate responses.

3.2 System Components

	1.	Embeddable Chat Interface
	•	Frontend:
	•	A floating icon that expands into a chat window upon click.
	•	Responsive design ensures compatibility with desktop, mobile, and tablet devices.
	•	Chat interface communicates with the backend using AJAX requests to fetch responses.
	2.	Backend (Flask)
	•	NLP Handler:
	•	Flask will receive the natural language query from the user via an API call.
	•	The query is sent to OpenAI’s API, which interprets the query and generates a structured response.
	•	Database Connector:
	•	Flask will interact with MySQL to retrieve or calculate the necessary data based on the interpreted query.
	•	Response Formatter:
	•	Data retrieved from the database will be processed and sent back to the frontend in a readable format (text, tables, or charts).
	3.	Database (MySQL)
	•	Schema:
The database will contain several key tables:
	•	Users: Stores user credentials and access controls.
	•	Portfolios: Stores portfolio-level data (account names, net values, gross values).
	•	Holdings: Stores holding information (dates, values, regions).
	•	Transactions: Stores financial transactions to calculate Time-Weighted Returns (TWR).
	•	Queries:
Example queries the system must handle:
	•	Calculate the net/gross portfolio values.
	•	Retrieve the minimum and maximum holding dates for an account.
	•	Aggregate and present a portfolio’s geographic distribution.
	4.	API Design
	•	Endpoints:
	•	/api/query: Receives user queries and returns formatted results.
	•	/api/authenticate: Handles user authentication using OAuth or token-based security.
	•	/api/portfolio/{id}: Fetches portfolio data for a specific user.
	5.	LLM (OpenAI)
	•	NLP Query Interpretation:
OpenAI’s API will be used to convert user queries into database actions. The interpreted query will then be sent to Flask, which in turn retrieves data from the MySQL database.
	•	Response Generation:
The LLM generates human-readable responses, including tables or charts if necessary. For example, a time-based query would result in a graph.

3.3 Security Considerations

	1.	Authentication
	•	OAuth will be used to securely log users in and verify their identity.
	2.	Data Encryption
	•	All sensitive information will be encrypted using TLS in transit and AES encryption for storage in the database.
	3.	Access Control
	•	Users will only be able to access data that belongs to them. This will be enforced through role-based access controls (RBAC).

3.4 Performance Considerations

	1.	Latency
	•	Target latency is under 1 second for query processing. Use of caching for frequently requested data.
	2.	Scalability
	•	The backend system (Flask) and MySQL database will be designed to handle large amounts of concurrent requests, leveraging load balancers and database replication if necessary.
